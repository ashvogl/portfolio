    "image": "/JWV9907.jpg",
    "primary": "I've always held a love for the worlds of design and technology, and since the beginning of my professional career I've strived to bring them together. I've spent the last several years developing proprietary software in an agile working environment, fostering my skills as a front-end developer. I love to take on challenging design problems, whether it's crafting a unified experience, untangling user feedback, or simply asking, \"How can we make this better?\"",
    "secondary": "When I'm not creating new features or hunting down bugs, I am an avid gamer, dungeon master, and artist. I especially love character design, making creatures and the realms they live in. I also take care of a little orange and white cat, who likes to be helpful by stepping on my keyboard."
